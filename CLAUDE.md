# Basic-10 Compiler Project Instructions

## Project Overview
Basic-10 is a BASIC to IC10 (MIPS) compiler for the game Stationeers. It converts high-level BASIC code into optimized IC10 assembly for use in the game's IC chips.

## Technology Stack
- .NET 8.0 WPF application (Windows only)
- AvalonEdit for code editing
- WebView2 for documentation display
- ASP.NET Core for HTTP API (MCP integration)

## Key Files
- `BasicToMips.csproj` - Project configuration and version number
- `UI/MainWindow.xaml(.cs)` - Main application window
- `UI/SettingsWindow.xaml(.cs)` - Settings dialog
- `UI/Services/SettingsService.cs` - Settings persistence
- `src/Lexer/` - Tokenization
- `src/Parser/` - AST generation
- `src/CodeGen/MipsGenerator.cs` - IC10 code generation
- `docs/` - Documentation files (copied to output)
- `Data/` - Device databases and JSON files

## Critical Rules

### Version Management
- **ALWAYS increment the version number in BasicToMips.csproj when making changes or adding features**
- Version is in `<Version>` tag (currently 1.7.3)
- Package naming follows format: `BasicToMips_v{version}.zip`

### Running Compiler
- **NEVER kill the compiler process without asking the user first**
- The user may have unsaved work
- Always ask before terminating Basic_10.exe
- The packaged version runs separately from bin folder builds

### Build & Package Commands
```powershell
# Build
dotnet build -c Release

# Publish
dotnet publish -c Release -o publish

# Package (update version in filename)
Compress-Archive -Path './publish/*' -DestinationPath './BasicToMips_v1.7.3.zip' -Force
```

### Testing Changes
- User prefers to test from the packaged version, not bin folder
- Build changes won't affect running packaged instance
- Ask user to close and reopen from new package to test

## MCP Integration
- HTTP API runs on port 19410 by default
- Endpoints: `/api/code`, `/api/properties`
- Enabled/disabled via settings

## Stationeers Integration
- Scripts saved to Stationeers scripts folder
- Each script is a folder containing:
  - `script.ic10` - The compiled IC10 code
  - `instruction.xml` - Metadata (Title, Description, Author)
- Title in instruction.xml should match the folder name
- Description auto-appends "Built in Basic-10"

## Symbols Panel
Tracks and displays:
- Variables (VAR, LET)
- Constants (CONST, DEFINE)
- Labels (word:)
- Aliases (ALIAS, DEVICE)
- Arrays (DIM)

## Recent Features Added
- Arrays support (DIM statements)
- Script metadata settings (Author, Description)
- Auto-save functionality
- Dynamic device aliases
- Named device references

## Settings Location
Settings stored in: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BasicToMips\settings.json`
